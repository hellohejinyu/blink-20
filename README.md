# Blink 20 👁️

**Protect your vision with the scientifically-backed 20-20-20 rule.**

Blink 20 is a sleek, intelligent eye-care assistant for VS Code tailored for developers who spend hours coding. It seamlessly integrates into your workflow to prevent digital eye strain without breaking your concentration.

## What is the 20-20-20 Rule?

The [American Optometric Association](https://www.aoa.org/) recommends:
> **Every 20 minutes**, take a **20-second break** and focus your eyes on something **20 feet (6 meters) away**.

This simple habit relaxes the focusing muscles inside the eye, reducing fatigue and preventing long-term damage.

## Features

### ⏱️ Smart Focus Timer
- **Automatic Tracking**: The timer starts when you open VS Code.
- **Continuous Mode**: Moving focus to another window does *not* stop the timer (short switching is considered work).
- **Smart Reset**: If you leave VS Code for more than **5 minutes**, the timer resets, assuming you've taken a break.
- **Multi-Window Sync**: The timer state is synchronized across all open VS Code windows.
- **State Persistence**: The timer state is saved, so restarting VS Code won't reset your progress.

### 🔔 Gentle yet Effective Reminders
- **Status Bar Integration**: A discreet `👁️ MM:SS` countdown keeps you informed.
- **Focus Mode**: When it's time to rest, a modal dialog gently interrupts your workflow.
- **Enforced Rest**: A 20-second progress bar guides you through the break.

### 🌍 Localization / 多语言支持
- **English**: Fully localized interface.
- **Chinese (简体中文)**: 完美支持中文界面，符合中文用户习惯。
